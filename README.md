## üìùProyect instructions 

The objective of this project is to put into practice the skills to modify and manipulate the DOM. The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure of the HTML document, which is made up of multiple tags nested one within another, forming a tree of related tags, called the DOM tree, or to simplify DOM.

In Javascript, when we refer to the DOM we refer to this structure, which we can modify dynamically with Javascript: adding new tags, modifying or eliminating others, changing its HTML attributes, adding classes, changing the text content, etc...

4. Create a function that applies styles to all columns varying the event
